## What is TURTLE (Texas A&M University Robotics Team and Leadership Experience)?

TURTLE Robotics is a dynamic, student-led robotics organization at Texas A&M University focused on innovation, collaboration, and mentorship. With over 250 members, we provide a space for students of all skill levels to explore robotics, build cutting-edge projects, and develop solutions for real-world challenges. From quadrupeds and drones to EMG-controlled prosthetics, our 14+ projects push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in robotics. 

Our mission is to inspire creativity, advance technical skills, increase the quality of the undergraduate roboticist at A&M, and foster a supportive community for aspiring engineers and scientists. Whether you're a robotics enthusiast or looking to get started, TURTLE offers opportunities for growth, hands-on experience, and impactful projects.

## My Role

As the **President/Principal Investiagor** of TURTLE Robotics, I oversee operations, mentor members, seek funding, and guide teams through innovative and impactful robotics projects. From technical design to team coordination, my role involves ensuring that every member has the resources and support needed to thrive. I've had the privilege of leading projects like:

- Building low-cost, open-source quadruped robots.
- Developing EMG-controlled prosthetics for real-world applications.
- Building an 8 legged robotic [strandbeest](https://www.strandbeest.com/)
- Guiding high/middle school students in their robotics journeys.

Through TURTLE, I aim to create an environment where students can not only learn but also contribute meaningfully to the field of robotics.
