I am a senior at Texas A&M University pursuing a BSc in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I am completing my undergraduate thesis under Dr. Gray Thomas at the Human-Empowering Robotics and Control Laboratory. My passion lies in software and controls engineering, particularly in locomanipulation and intelligent control. Iâ€™ve contributed to cutting-edge research in upper/lower limb exoskeletons, strength amplification, and robotics design. I also lead a robotics lab focused on innovation and mentorship. With skills in Python, C++, ROS2, and machine learning, I aim to develop reliable, intelligent and trustworthy control systems for tomorrows robots.
