I am a senior at Texas A&M University pursuing a BSc in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I am completing my undergraduate thesis under [Dr. Gray Thomas](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/thomas-gray.html) at the [Human-Empowering Robotics and Control Laboratory](https://herc.engr.tamu.edu/). My passion lies in software and controls engineering, particularly in locomanipulation and intelligent control. Iâ€™ve contributed to cutting-edge research in upper/lower limb exoskeletons, strength amplification, and robotics design. I also lead a robotics lab focused on innovation and mentorship. With skills in Python, C++, ROS2, and machine learning, I aim to develop reliable, intelligent, and trustworthy control systems for tomorrow's robots.

## Hobbies outside of my passion for cool robots

- **Hiking**: If I am not in the lab I am on a hike, this world is just too big and beautiful to look at pictures of it. 
- **MMA/Kickboxing**: I have been a kickboxer since the age of 6, after a long career I have shifted my focus to engineering but once in a while the mats call in the summer and I return to a local MMA gym.
- **Fitness**: Staying active through lifting, very good for the brain on an early morning.
- **Gaming**: Playing strategy and simulation games to relax. Ends up being not so relaxing.
