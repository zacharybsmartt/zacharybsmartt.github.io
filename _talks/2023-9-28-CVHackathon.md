After my tenure at Rani Therapautics as a Robotics R&D Intern, where my job revolved around computer vision and control, I spent this seminar giving students all they needed to start their first projects in computer vision with OpenCV in Python. This included a math background, common methods, libraries, and image detecton and segmentation techniques with help of TensorFlow.
